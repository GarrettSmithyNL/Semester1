          <h2>A Brief History</h2>
          <p>
            Edgar Allan Poe, son of Actress

            <span class="BlueAndBold">David Poe Jr.</span>, born 19th of January
            1809, was mostly known for his poems and short tales and his
            literary criticism. He has been given credit for inventing the
            detective story and his psychological thrillers have been influences
            for many writers worldwide.

            <span class="UnderText">Tamerlane and other poems</span>
            anonymously under the signature "A Bostonian". The poems were
            heavily influenced from

            provides a retreat into early nineteenth century Richmond where
            Edgar Allan Poe lived and worked. The museum features the life and
            career of Edgar Allan Poe by documenting his accomplishments with
            pictures, relics, and verse, and focusing on his many years in
            Richmond. Opened in 1922, in The Old Stone House, the museum is only
            blocks away from Poe's first Richmond home and his first place of
            employment, the Southern Literary Messenger.

              Than to love and be loved by me.

              I would define, in brief, the Poetry of words as the Rhythmical
              Creation of Beauty.<br />
              Its sole arbiter is Taste.

              Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there, wondering,
              fearing,<br />
              Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dreamed before.

            <p>
              The skies they were ashen and sober;<br />
              The leaves they were crisped and sere - The leaves they were
              withering and sere; <br />
              It was night in the lonesome October,<br />
              Of my most immemorial year.<br />

            Poe suffered from bouts of depression and madness, and he attempted
            suicide in 1848. In September the following year he disappeared for
            three days after a drink at a birthday party on his way to visit his
            new fianc√©e in Richmond. He turned up in a delirious condition in a
