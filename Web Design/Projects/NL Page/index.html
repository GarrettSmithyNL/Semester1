            has officially been the provincial bird of Newfoundland and Labrador
            since 1991. It is a member of the auk family. The puffin is also
            called the sea parrot because of its multi-coloured beak. Marine
            birds that inhabit cliffs, puffins can dive 50 metres underwater in
            search of food. Their diet consists mostly of small fish such as
            caplin and herring. Their wingspan is approximately 55 cm., and they
            can fly up to 80 km. per hour. They live approximately 25 years,
            usually mate for life, and produce one egg per year. Witless Bay,
            Newfoundland, is home to the largest puffin colony in North America.
